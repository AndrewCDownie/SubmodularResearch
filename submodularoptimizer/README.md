# Distributed Submodular Optimization Package
This is my Repository for my Masters Research at the University of Waterloo in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

I am working with Professor Stephen L. Smith(Waterloo) and Professor Bahman Gharesifard(Queen's) on a Submodular Optimization under Distributed Constraints. In in Research we are exploring how distance metrics can be leveraged to improved how multiple agents can work together to maxmize a submodular objective function with incomplete communication information.
